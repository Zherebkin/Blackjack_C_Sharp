# Blackjack game
I have made this project for Object oriented programming course at my college.
Project is made in Visual studio 2017 using C# programming language. The purpose of this project was to study object oriented paradigm and its main features ,then implement that knowledge and create this kind of game.
The user is playing standard Blackjack game with 8 decks,against dealer(computer) who is playing by the fixed rules(there is no element of skill). There are 2 more players added in the game(also played by computer,using known Blackjack basic strategy).
